# AzerothCoreProgression
It is not a 1:1 mapping of the patch. Only disabled gears, emblems, gems, dgs, raids, quests and some other feature that significantly affects the balance of the game.
There is only 3.3 to 3.0 script here. I will work on 3.0 to 3.1, 3.1 to 3.2, then eventually 3.2 to 3.3 scripts later. You are very welcome to contribute the sctips.
The Script hasn't been tested yet. You may test it and report the issue.
The progression module of AC doesn't work after TBC. And this script doesn't compatible with AC progression module.
Beawre that, SQL operation doesn't support an UNDO operation, always backup your database before you apply the SQL scripts.
